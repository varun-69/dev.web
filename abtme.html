            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Varun, rhymes with Barun, and I'm a <strong>Singer</strong> and <strong>front
                    end dev</strong> by profession.
            <p />

            <p>I think it's important to help make the internet a <strong>beautiful place</strong>, whether that be
                through words, talent, or web design.</p>

            <p>I also think it's important to push yourself and <strong>learn</strong> one new thing every day, no
             matter what that may be. Did you know a duel between three people is called a <a

            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
            <p>I love to explore new cities, take photographs, eat tacos, catnap with my cat, bike to big lakes, hold
                hands, play video games, dance in hay lofts, spend weekends with my grandpa, drink good <a
                    href="http://www.proof66.com/whiskey/eagle-rare-10yr-bourbon.html">whiskey</a>, and sit outside all
                night on porches.</h2>

            <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
            <p>A Singer. Just kidding, I would love to be a full-time <strong>creative</strong> who's
                given an array of responsibilities in front-end work, design, and whatever else comes my
                way.</p>

            <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
            <p>My friends and I recently tripped through Manali listening to the some dangling bollywood songs<a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdyaixHYviA">YJHD</a>. I don't know what it is about them, but they make you
                want to keep going and going.
